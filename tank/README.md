to run this game you need a webserver. 
if python3 is installed cd into this directory and run:
python3 -m http.server

then connect to the ip address of the machine port 8000
for example, my linux machine is at address 192.168.1.105
so in the web browser I use the url:
http://192.168.1.105:8000

click on the canva and run the game
